## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **1. Updated `createPurchase` Function**

**Location**: `backend/controllers/purchaseController.js`

**Changes**:
```javascript
// BEFORE: Stock only added after receipt generation
await purchase.save();
// Stock will ONLY be added to warehouse when payment status is marked as "paid"

// AFTER: Stock added immediately
await purchase.save();

// Add stock to warehouse IMMEDIATELY when purchase is created
console.log('Adding stock to warehouse for purchase:', purchase.purchaseNumber);
await purchase.updateStockAfterPayment();

// Also update product variant stock
console.log('Updating product variant stock...');
for (const item of purchase.items) {
  const product = await Product.findById(item.productId);
  if (product && product.hasVariants && product.variants && item.variantId) {
    const variant = product.variants.find(v => 
      v._id?.toString() === item.variantId || v.sku === item.variantId
    );
    if (variant) {
      variant.stock = (variant.stock || 0) + item.quantity;
      console.log(`Updated variant ${variant.name}: ${variant.stock} units`);
      await product.save();
    }
  }
}
```

### **2. Updated `generateReceipt` Function**

**Changes**:
```javascript
// BEFORE: Added stock when generating receipt
await purchase.updateStockAfterPayment();

// AFTER: Stock already added, just mark payment as paid
// NOTE: Stock is already added when purchase is created
// No need to add stock again when generating receipt
```

### **3. Updated `markPaymentCleared` Function**

**Changes**:
```javascript
// BEFORE: Called markPaymentCleared which added stock again
await purchase.markPaymentCleared();

// AFTER: Just mark payment as paid (stock already added)
purchase.paymentStatus = 'paid';
purchase.paymentDate = new Date();
await purchase.generateReceipt();
await purchase.save();
```
